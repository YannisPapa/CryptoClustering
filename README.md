# CryptoClustering

This is my submission for Module 19 Challenge with Berkeley Data Analytics Boot Camp.

There is one subfilder holding crypto_market_data.csv data file used in Crypto_Clustering.ipynb.

Running Crypto_Clustering.ipynb will give you a notebook that looks at using K-means and PCA to cluster Data. It will first use the eblow method to find what is the best K value to use when clustering for both K-means and PCA, then it gets the predicted clusters and plots them.
